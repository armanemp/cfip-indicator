# CFIP — Cross-Chat Continuation State

Last updated: 2026-09-30

## Authoritative order

1. Claude review remediation: `docs/CLAUDE-REVIEW-REMEDIATION-ROADMAP.md`
2. Master roadmap: `docs/ROADMAP.md`
3. Only after `CR-FINAL`: local cBot separation Track 12A.

## Active phase

**CR1.7 — Threshold truth + volume audit (Prompt 1 / A9 + A10).**

## Completed before this checkpoint

- CR-0 audit gate
- CR1.1 session/EOD + closed-period references
- CR1.2 daily-loss accounting/lock
- CR1.3 news guard refresh/state handling
- CR1.4 closed-bar cycle ordering/readiness state
- CR1.5 hot-path/cache/logging optimization

## Rules for every continuation

- Complete exactly one CR phase per implementation response.
- Perform the project-wide routine audit: Analysis → Decision → Signal → Alert → Execution → Broker confirmation → Protection/Lifecycle → Outcome → Learning.
- Run the performance/code-cleanliness audit in the same phase.
- Keep public parameter name/type/DefaultValue unchanged unless a new safety parameter is explicitly required.
- Every fix gets its own `fix(<ID>): ...` commit.
- Every logical change gets real deterministic behavior tests.
- Do not start or advance cBot separation until `CR-FINAL` passes.
- Never claim target-terminal verification from CI alone.

## Next transition

CR1.6 is complete. The next implementation response must execute **CR1.7** and only CR1.7.
